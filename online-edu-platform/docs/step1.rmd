Exactly—that's a great place to start. Here’s a clean and simple step-by-step to kick off your Django-based project properly:

---

### 📁 Step 1: Create a Project Folder
```bash
mkdir online-edu-platform
cd online-edu-platform
```

This keeps all your code, virtual environment, and project files in one place.

---

### 🐍 Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment (Best Practice)
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Now your Python environment is isolated—nothing system-wide gets affected.

---

### 📦 Step 3: Install Django (and optionally Django REST Framework)
```bash
pip install django djangorestframework
```

You can always install more packages later.

---

### 🚀 Step 4: Create Your Django Project
```bash
django-admin startproject edu_auth .
```

The `.` at the end means it installs the project in your current folder instead of a nested one.

---

### 🧪 Step 5: Run It to Confirm It Works
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser—you should see the Django welcome page!
